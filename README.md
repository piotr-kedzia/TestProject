# Introduction 

In the backend project I decided to give up the Entity Framework in favor of the simpler and faster mini ORM Dapper. The reason was that Dapper is faster, less heavy, and better suited to smaller and simpler programs. The second decision was to stick to a pattern consistent with SOLID principles. 

For the frontend project, I decided to use the Angular framework. For JavaScript I used the Typescript overlay. The reason is increasing popularity of that framework. The advantage of Angular over React is that Angular has stable solutions developed by Microsoft.
